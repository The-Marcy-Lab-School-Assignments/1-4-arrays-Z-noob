# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
`name` was not changed because `changeName` function is not reassigning name, it's reassigning the parameter or the value of `name`. So, even though it's `let`, to actually reassign the `name` in function, it needs to be `name = "tom";` in or outside the function to reassign. But for the `favoriteLocations`, it's  array is getting modified. Another way to showcase this is the top function look like "mike" = "tom", while the bottom looks like ["New York City", "Jersey City"].unshift("Boston). "Pass by Value" vs "Pass by Reference".
